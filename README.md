Userscripts
===========

This repository is for work on my userscripts. These are Javascript scripts that run in web browsers, possibly via extensions like Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey, to modify the appearance and functionality of websites.  Mostly these will extend the geocaching.com website.

There's not much to see here yet!

Production versions of the scripts will be listed on [OpenUserJS.org](https://openuserjs.org/users/JRI/scripts)

My homepage for this work is at [geo.inge.org.uk](http://geo.inge.org.uk/greasemonkey.htm)
